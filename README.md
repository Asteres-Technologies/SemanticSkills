# SemanticSkills
A collection of semantic skills for AI in the form of prompt templates used to query LLMs.

## Description Files
The SemanticSkills repository contains a variety of skill descriptions that define the capabilities and inputs/outputs of each skill. These descriptions are stored in separate files, following a standard format.

### Description Format
Each description file follows the format outlined below:

```toml
[description]
skill_name = "Skill Name"
skill_description = "A brief description of the skill."
output_name = "Output Name"
output_description = "A description of the output/result generated by the skill."
output_uses = "A description of how the output can be used."
output_type = "The type of output (e.g., text/string, JSON, etc.)"
[[description.arguments]]
argument_name = "Argument Name"
argument_identifier = "Argument Identifier"
argument_description = "A description of the argument."
argument_sources = "A description of where the argument can be sourced from."
argument_type = "The expected type of the argument." 
```

### Example Description File
Here's an example of a description file for a skill:

```toml
[description]
skill_name = "FunSkill.Excuses"
skill_description = "The skill is the ability to generate creative and humorous excuses for a given event."
output_name = "excuse"
output_description = "A creative and humorous excuse for the given event."
output_uses = "Can be used to provide a humorous response to a given event."
output_type = "text/string"
[[description.arguments]]
argument_name = "input"
argument_identifier = "{{$input}}"
argument_description = "The event for which an excuse is needed."
argument_sources = "Provided by the user or extracted from conversation/dialogue."
argument_type = "text/string"
```

### Purpose of the Repository
The SemanticSkills repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of semantic skills that can be used to enhance AI capabilities. These skills cover a wide range of domains and use cases, enabling AI systems to perform specific tasks and generate meaningful outputs based on given inputs.

By maintaining a standardized description format for the skills, the repository ensures consistency and ease of integration into AI systems. The descriptions act as a reference, providing clear documentation of each skill's purpose, inputs, and outputs. This allows developers and researchers to easily incorporate these skills into their projects and leverage the power of AI to accomplish various tasks.

### Future Development
The SemanticSkills repository is an evolving project, with continuous additions of new skills and potential future contributions from AI systems. The aim is to expand the repository's offerings to encompass a broad range of domains, allowing AI models to provide more comprehensive and sophisticated responses to user queries and prompts.

Additionally, the repository welcomes community contributions and feedback. Developers and researchers are encouraged to submit their own skill descriptions, further enriching the collection and promoting collaboration in the AI community.

We hope that the SemanticSkills repository serves as a valuable resource for enhancing the capabilities of AI models and fostering innovation in natural language processing and understanding.

## Acknowledgements
### Contributions
We would like to acknowledge Microsoft for their invaluable contributions to this project. The majority of the skills included in the SemanticSkills repository are derived from Microsoft's Semantic Kernel Samples. These samples have provided a solid foundation and served as a source of inspiration for the development of this repository.

By leveraging the insights gained from the efforts of Semantic Kernel, we have been able to research standardization and best practices relating to prompt templating at a much faster rate than we could have without such a database of skills.

### Future Collaboration
We welcome ongoing opensource efforts from Microsoft and other contributors to further enrich the SemanticSkills repository. Together, we can continue to explore the potential of language models and advance the field of natural language processing.

We extend our sincere gratitude to Microsoft and all the contributors for their dedication and efforts in advancing the state of the art in AI and language understanding.
